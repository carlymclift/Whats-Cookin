## Abstract
On What's Cookin's main page a user is given a selection of available recipes to cook. They are also able to view their pantry contents, a shopping list and have the ability to save meals for later.

With each page refresh, a new random user see's a selection of recipes cards they can choose from. They can interact by saving the recipe to "Meals to Cook" or add a recipe to their favorite list. If a user tries to add a meal to cook without having the required ingredients for that recipe, then their shopping list will update for them!

## In Action
Below is the home page for What's Cookin'. Here the user is greeted and the available recipes are displayed:
