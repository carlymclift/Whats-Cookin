## Abstract
On What's Cookin's main page a user is given a selection of available recipes to cook. They are also able to view their pantry contents, a shopping list and have the ability to save meals for later.

With each page refresh, a new random user see's a selection of recipes cards they can choose from. They can interact by saving the recipe to "Meals to Cook" or add a recipe to their favorites list. If a user tries to add a meal to cook without having the required ingredients for that recipe, then their shopping list will update for them.

## In Action
Below is the home page for What's Cookin'. Here the user is greeted and the available recipes are displayed:

A user can save a recipe by clicking the heart of any card and later view it in their favorites section:

A user can press the plus button on any card to add the recipe to their list of meals to cook. However, if a user tries to add a meal without having the necessary ingredients, then they will be alerted and those ingredients will be put in their shopping list.

## Learning Goals
- Make a fully working application using API's
- Make use of OOP and prototype methods
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite, and use TDD.
- Create a data dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

### Wins
- Furthered practice with TDD, prototype methods, css styling and OOP

### Set-backs
- Time was our biggest setback of the project. Functionality to be added later on includes: Enabling the search bar, additional styling, and adding cost and ingredient amounts to the pantry and shopping list.
